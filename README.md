# Abnormal Detection for Corporate Internal Security
This project aims to prevent corporate internal security (especially data leakage through storage device) using customized YOLOv3.  You can find referenced code [here](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3). 

> This code is not provided due to security concerns and it is Enterprise Cooperation Project.

## Dataset
The dataset is about 9,000 images included a total of 12 PCs and 5 people.
Using **YOLO-v3**, I used images to insert a storage device (such as USB) into a PC.
Three out of five people were recognized through **face recognition** and **face classification** and we call these ***insider***.
And the other two people we call ***outsider***.  just goes through **face recognition**.
